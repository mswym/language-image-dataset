# Language-biased image classification: evaluation based on semantic representations
This repository shares the source codes used in our ICLR 2022 paper, "Language-biased image classification:
evaluation based on semantic representations" by Lemesle*, Y., Sawayama*, M., Valle-Perez, G., Adolphe, M., Sauz√©on, H., & Oudeyer, P. Y. 
*equal contribution


The source codes are to create the word-superimposed images
from the image datasets (Cichy et al., 2016; Mohsenzadeh et al., 2019) and to reproduce the analysis results shown in the paper. 
We evaluated the pre-trained CLIP models (Radford et al., 2021) by using our benchmark test.
